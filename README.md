Direct, low-level control of Micro-Manager device adapters in Python.

## Rationale

Perhaps the most valuable asset of Micro-Manager is the vast
library of device adapters that have been written over the years â€“ including
contributions from commercial vendors.  While new python packages arise
from time to time with the goal of creating a fundamentally new device interface,
they all suffer from the problem of limited device support (typically,
they only implement the set of devices that the authors immediately need).  It
is just super hard to recreate what Micro-Manager has built up over the years.

For most use cases, if you want to use Micro-Manager devices directly in Python,
you will use install the [`pymmcore`](https://github.com/micro-manager/pymmcore)
(or [`pymmcore-plus`](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-plus)) package
and instantiate an instance of `pymmcore.CMMCore` (or
`pymmcore_plus.CMMCorePlus`).  Then, to load a specific device adapter, you
would call `loadDevice('MyLabel', 'ModuleName', 'DeviceName')`.  All control of
the device is routed through the `CMMCore` instance, and is therefore subject to
the `CMMCores` model and API.

This library is an experimental lower-level wrapper around the MMDevice API that
gives you *direct* control over device adapter libraries, without going through
core.  This means that you could have nothing more than a single compiled device
adapter (i.e. one of the `libmmgr_dal_` libraries that you find inside of the
Micro-Manager directory) and still control it from Python.

## Installation

```sh
pip install pymmdevice
```

## Development

### Clone the repo and initialize the submodules

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tlambert03/pymmdevice.git --recurse-submodules
cd pymmdevice
```

### Create a virtual environment

You can do this however you prefer:

```sh
# e.g
mamba create -n pymmdevice python=3.11
mamba activate pymmdevice

# or
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install in editable mode *without* build isolation

Meson-python is used to build the pybind11 extension, and editable installs in
meson-python currently require disabling build isolation.  See [meson-python
docs](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-guides/editable-installs.html)
for more information.

This means you must also install the build dependencies manually
before running `pip install -e .`

```sh
pip install meson-python meson ninja pybind11
pip install -e ".[dev]" --no-build-isolation
```

### Run tests

#### One time setup

The tests require a compiled `libmmgr_dal_DemoCamera` library from
Micro-Manager.  I do this by using the build-dev command from
[pymmcore-plus](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-plus) (which will have
been installed in the `[dev]` extra above.)

```sh
mmcore build-dev DemoCamera
```

However, if you would like to point to a different location, you can set the
`MM_LIB_DIR` environment variable to the directory containing the compiled
libraries. (This directory must minimally contain `libmmgr_dal_DemoCamera`)

Then you can run the tests:

```sh
pytest
```

Note that compiled files end up in `build/` directory and are dynamically loaded
at import time and test time.  This means you can make changes to the pybind11
wrapper and simply re-run the tests without re-installing.

### Troubleshooting

- `ERROR: File  does not exist.` when building or running `pip install -e .`

    You likely didn't initialize the submodules when you cloned the repo.  Run:

    ```sh
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

- General Reset

    After the initial install, one problem that can arise occasionally is a stale
`build/` directory.  If you encounter errors during the build process, try
removing the `build/` directory and re-installing.

    ```sh
    rm -rf build && pip install -e . --no-build-isolation --force-reinstall
    ```

### Generating type stubs

```sh
pybind11-stubgen pymmdevice._pymmdevice -o src
```
